    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, I plan to examine what news outlets, topics and articles are most popular on social media platforms in relation to different news topics. In addition to seeing what types of news these social media platforms are spreading, I will examine how the sentiment scores of the titles and headlines of news articles correlate to their popularity, which can then be related back to the platforms. This analysis will help uncover some of the underlying motivations of social media platforms as well as uncover whether sentiment is related to the popularity of an article and, if they do, whether positive or negative sentiments have a greater correlation with the popularity of news. From a human-centered perspective, this will help inform people about the tendencies of the social media platforms they use and help them to understand how their psychology gravitates toward certain types of news. I hope to understand how people interact with news on social media platforms on a daily basis in order to gain a better understanding about how human psychology interacts with news on social media."

    "## Data Selected for Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset [News Popularity in Multiple Social Media Platforms](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Popularity+in+Multiple+Social+Media+Platforms) represents collected data of about 100,000 different news items on four different topics: Economy, Microsoft, Obama and Palestine over the span of 8 months, between November 2015 and July 2016. To download the raw dataset via the hyperlink above, click \"Data Folder\", \"Data/\", \"News_Final.csv\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has a unique identifier for news items, the title of the news item according to the official media sources, the headline of the news item according to the official media sources, the original news outlet that published the news item, the query topic used to obtain the items in the official media sources, the date and time of the news items' publication, the final value of the news items' popularity according to the social media sources (Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn), the sentiment score of the title, and the sentiment score of the text in the news items' headline. The process to obtain these sentiment scores was carried out by applying the framework of the `qdap` [R package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/qdap/versions/2.4.3) with default parametrization. Additional information about the dataset can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07055.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is suitable for addressing my research goal because it provides a vast array of different news articles in relation to three different social media platforms as well as a sentiment analysis. I believe that the narrowed scope of four different news topics will allow me to understand the tendencies of these platforms rather than trying to categorize each article into topics as I move through the data. Additionally I believe Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn are all different enough from each other to gain an understanding of the types of articles that are popluar in the different ecosystems (social, casual, professional) of social media platforms. Some things that need to be noted when looking at this dataset is that the popularity scores of the news items are given by the social media sources, and that the sentiment scores are provided by a machine learning algorithm whose details are not provided in the notebook. This could lead to biased results that either favor the social media companies and/or don't accurately reflect the sentiments of the news items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, the value of the popularity of news items at a given moment (i.e. timeslice) was not acquirable.\n",
    "These cases are denoted with the value −1, which are mostly associated to scenarios where the items are\n",
    "suggested in official media sources after two days have passed since its publication in the original news outlet.\n",
    "Such situations represent 12.4% of cases concerning the final popularity of items according to the social media\n",
    "source Facebook, and 6.2% of cases for both Google+ and LinkedIn sources.\n",

    "Previous research has sought to uncover some of the factors related to news popularity on social media platforms. One study titled [The Pulse of News in Social Media: Forecasting Popularity](https://www.hpl.hp.com/research/scl/papers/newsprediction/pulse.pdf) found that the most important predictor of the popularity of an article was its source. Additionally, another study titled [Are You What You Tweet? The Impact of Sentiment on Digital News Consumption and Social Media Sharing](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2022.1112) found that an increase in the sentiment of content increased how much the article was shared on social media, but decreased how many people actually opened the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these studies help to inform my the way I approached this study. Specifically, the first study guided me toward asking whether certain news sources were more popular than others. And if so, I wanted to investigate if this was consistent across social media platforms. On the other hand, the second study made me wonder how much variation there was between the sentiment of the title and headline for each article. The second study mentioned previously specifically focused on Twitter to gather their data, so I wanted to see if their findings were consistent across other social media platforms."

    "## Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the answers to my research questions, I will use different methods withinin Python depending on the variables I am using.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Questions 1, 2, and 3 I will perform **quantitative analysis** by conducting a **Spearman Rank Correlation** in Python. I chose this method because it is most suitable to find out the relationship between two ranked variables (the sentiment scores and the popularity scores) that are non-parametric. I will import the CSV dataset as a dataframe using `Pandas` and import `spearmanr` from `scipy.stats` in order to analyze the data. I will present my results by showing my model output and then describing the meaning behind the specific coefficients produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spearman Rank function will return a rho-value and a p-value. The rho-value describes the relationship between the two variables being analyzed and will return a value ranging from -1 to +1. A rho-value of -1 denotes a perfect negative relationship between two variables, a rho-value value of 0 denotes no relationship between two variables, and a rho-value value of +1 denotes a perfect positive relationship between two variables. On the other hand, the p-value tells us whether the rho-value is statistically significant. If the p-value of the correlation is less than 0.05, then the correlation is considered to be statistically significant. Anything above this considered negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Questions 4, 5 and 6, I will perform **qualitative analysis** on the most popular articles for each social media platform. I chose qualitative analysis for these questions because it will allow me to order the data in descending order of popularity and then isolate the desired variable (topics, sentiments and sources). Using Python, I will look at the the 10 most popular articles for each social media platform and determine whether any patterns emerge from the data. I plan on presenting the results of my qualitative analysis as an individual table for each social media platform and each variable being looked at (3 tables for each question). Below each table I will describe if any patterns emerge. For example, Question 4 will present a table containing the variables of popularity, the topic, and the social media platform being looked at. This will be followed by a descriptive analysis. After my description will be the second table for Question 4 which will have the same exact variables except the social media platform will be different. This table will then be followed by its own descriptive analysis, and so forth.\n",

Knowing these two things, I can confidentally infer that **the most popular sources on LinkedIn are notable and tend to be related to the professionalism that LinkedIn as a platform is used for**."

    "### Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to discuss my findings, I am going to talk about each question separately while making some connections between findings along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 1) Does the sentiment of an article title correlate to its popularity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the correlation was small, my findings for Facebook and Google+ (and LinkedIn although it was statistically insignificant) aligned with my hypothesis that the sentiment of an article title negatively correlated with its popularity. This means that articles with more negative titles tend to be more popular on Facebook and Google+, even if it occurs unintentionally. This is something that should be taken into consideration by users when using these social media platforms for news information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 2) Does the sentiment of an article headline correlate to its popularity?\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from this analysis showed that all three social media platforms had a positive correlation bewteen the sentiment of the article headline and its popularity. This is interesting given the negative correlations present on the previous question. This finding may mean that there isn't a causal relationship between sentiment and popularity, but this can only be confirmed with further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 3) Is there a correlation between the sentiments of article headlines and the article titles?\n",
    "\n",
    "This was an important question to research because if they were negatively correlated (and the sentiment of an article title was negatively correlated to popularity), it could suggest that the publishers were manipulating the article titles to increase their popularity. Unfortunately (for the sake of this research) the sentiements of the article headlines and article titles were positively correlated eliminating this theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 4) What article topics are most popular on social media platforms?\n",
    "\n",
    "I predicted that the most controversial topics would be the most popular articles on social media, but only one of the social media platforms (Facebook) aligned with this theory. Facebook has been known for its [controversial news feed algorithm](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/13/facebook-news-feed-algorithm-how-to-turn-it-off/), so this makes sense. On the other hand, Google+ and LinkedIn disproved my hypothesis. Since LinkedIn promoted Microsoft content (which purchased LinkedIn) and Facebook promoted controversial topics I believe that rather than simply promoting controversial topics, social media platforms promote news articles that are beneficial to their cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 5) Do social media platforms popularize articles with certain sentiments over others?\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the results from Questions 1 and 2 being mixed, I didn't know if this question would bring about anything worth noting (and unfortunately it did not). Because the most popular articles on Google+ were mainly negative in its titles and headlines, the most popular articles on LinkedIn were mainly positive in its titles and headlines, and the most popular articles on Facebook didn't show a trend with regards to sentiment, I cannot make any claims about the subject. Looking at a greater amount of article may help, but the very small correlations from Questions 1 and 2 imply that the results may not differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 6) What sources are most popular on social media platforms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although LinkedIn showed a trend in what types of article sources were the most popular, this was not my original intention when asking this question. I wanted to see if social media platforms promoted sources that were either controversial, not well-known, or extremely notable (Fox, CNN, WSJ, etc.). LinkedIn showed some promise of the most popular sources being notable, but its variation in sources and the subjectivity around this topic makes it difficult for me to make any claims. Additionally, the fact that Facebook and Google+ didn't seem to show any trends with regards to the popularity of sources supports this reasoning."

    "### Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the correlations found during this study, this implies that there is a chance some of these correlations could contain causality. Further research should look further into whether or not there is a causality between sentiment and popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the findings in this research suggests that there isn't a \"standard\" for social media across platforms. Further research should dive deeper into specific platforms, especially since their popularity has only risen since the collection of this dataset."

    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest limitation of this dataset is not having the number of users on each platform during the time of the dataset collection. This would have provided more context about the social media platforms. Additionally Google+ is no longer a social media platform and never became popular compared to LinkedIn and Facebook, mitigating its present-day relevance of its findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation of this dataset is that it doesn't prove causality. Obviously it is beneficial to research whether a correlation exists between two variables, but researching causality would highlight if social media platforms have underlying motivations with regards to their news."

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this study was to uncover the hidden motivations of social media platforms as well as inform users about their tendecies in relation to the news they interact with on social media. Although a lot of the findings weren't related, **I can conclude that there is a correlation between sentiment and popularity, but it is inconsistent between article titles and headlines as well as across platforms**. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysises helped to reveal some of the trends of news on social media, but further research is necessary. This study provides a solid framework to conduct further research about how people interact with news on social media and whether there is a causal relationship between sentiment and popularity."
