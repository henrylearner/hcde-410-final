# Final Project:

I plan to examine what news outlets, topics and articles are most popular on three different social media platforms (Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn) in relation to different four different news topics: Economy, Microsoft, Obama and Palestine. In addition to seeing what types of news these social media platforms are spreading, I will examine how the sentiment scores of the titles and headlines of news articles affect their popularity, which can then be related back to the platforms.
